# Instance discovery and pairing contract v1

**Status:** Canonical target contract. Product implementation and qualification are separately governed.

This contract is shared by Forge Server, Engineering Platform (EP) Server and Workspace Server. It gives the installer and product-owned clients one safe way to find a candidate, prove which instance it is, and create an explicit binding. It does not create a shared runtime, database, authorization domain, or service registry authority.

## Descriptor and discovery

Every installed server owns a random, stable, opaque `instance_id`. The ID is created with its installation identity, survives ordinary restart/update and is included in product-owned backup/restore semantics. It is never derived from a hostname, IP address, checkout, project or mDNS name. A replacement or a deliberately reissued identity is a different instance.

`forge-platform.instance-descriptor/v1` is the public candidate document:

```json
{
  "schema": "forge-platform.instance-descriptor/v1",
  "product": "forge-server | ep-server | workspace-server",
  "instance_id": "opaque-stable-id",
  "api": [{"version": "v1", "endpoint": "https://host.example/api/v1"}],
  "capabilities": ["health", "pairing", "..."],
  "identity_fingerprint": "public-key-or-certificate-fingerprint",
  "expires_at": "RFC3339 timestamp"
}
```

Implementations may add non-sensitive display metadata, but descriptors and discovery records contain **no** bearer credential, pairing secret, project or repository data, account data, queue/run state, path, log, or private topology. Unknown required fields and unsupported schema/API versions fail closed.

LAN discovery may advertise a short-lived descriptor through DNS-SD/mDNS (for example `_forge-platform._tcp`, with product, descriptor version, instance ID, API versions and a descriptor endpoint/fingerprint in TXT data). It is only a candidate locator. A configured HTTPS/unicast endpoint, private-overlay or tailnet endpoint is an equal bootstrap route and is required where multicast is unavailable. Discovery never implies reachability, authenticity, authorization or permission to bind.

## Authenticated pairing and durable binding

An operator or an already authorized product principal starts a pairing flow. The initiating side verifies the endpoint's authenticated identity fingerprint, product, stable ID, supported API/capabilities and requested scope. The target performs its own authentication/authorization and creates a short-lived, single-use pairing ceremony. On completion each owning product persists its own binding through its application service/API: peer product, `instance_id`, verified fingerprint, endpoint set, negotiated versions/capabilities, scope, creation/rotation evidence and revocation state.

Discovery is deliberately not a pairing API. Neither the Forge Platform installer nor a peer writes directly to another product database. An existing binding is pinned to its recorded instance ID and fingerprint: rediscovery of a different candidate, changed fingerprint or changed endpoint identity fails closed and requires an explicit inspect/re-pair/rebind operation. Endpoint rotation for the same identity follows the product's authenticated binding update protocol; it is never an automatic switch to a newly found instance.

Trust domains remain separate:

| Relationship | Trust owner | It must not become |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace Client ↔ Workspace Server | Workspace user/session | server-peer or EP Agent trust |
| EP Project Agent ↔ EP Server | EP host/agent | Workspace Client or Forge peer trust |
| Forge/EP/Workspace Server peers | respective product peer bindings | a user session or Agent credential |

Co-location and loopback do not remove authentication, pairing or authorization.

## Server-operational invariants

Each server is a headless, independently restartable installed service with a product-owned runtime storage root outside source/Git checkouts. Its versioned HTTP API is a transport adapter over interface-neutral application services; direct cross-product SQL and shared databases are prohibited. On macOS the product publishes a launchd service contract; Forge Platform orchestrates its lifecycle but does not become its runtime authority. Product storage contains its own SQL database and product-owned files, artifacts, logs, backups and cache, with permissions, retention, migration and recovery defined by the product owner.

## Delivery sequencing

The first Forge → EP → Forge autonomy canary needs only the minimum seams: installed Forge/EP service storage and stable identity, their versioned authenticated HTTP contract, an explicitly configured/pinned EP binding, and restart-safe recovery. It does **not** require Workspace UI, LAN discovery or the universal installer to be complete. Network discovery, full pairing UX, all topology combinations, Workspace Client distribution and installer productization are post-canary capabilities; they must preserve these seams.
