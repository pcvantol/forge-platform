# Forge Platform Architecture

## Purpose and status

This is the canonical high-level architecture entrypoint for the Forge Platform ecosystem composition. It records product and trust boundaries needed for later work; it does not implement an installer, service, protocol, scheduler, authentication flow, artifact publication, or Schema 41.

Forge Platform is a first-class product repository, not a canonical project authority repository for a customer's product. A **Canonical Project Authority Repository** is a logical product's durable topology authority; `pcvantol/forge-platform` is the Forge-family distribution and deployment product.

Detailed decisions are recorded in the [ADRs](adr/README.md). The [ownership matrix](OWNERSHIP_MATRIX.md) is the concise authority reference.

The [Governed Engineering Knowledge Learning Loop](KNOWLEDGE_LEARNING_LOOP.md) records the independently owned Knowledge Base lifecycle and its additive cross-product integration boundary.

## First-class component model

| Repository | First-class authority / published component |
| --- | --- |
| `pcvantol/forge` | Forge Runtime: architecture planning and orchestration |
| `pcvantol/workspace` | Workspace Server and Workspace Client(s) |
| `pcvantol/engineering-platform` | Engineering Platform Server and Engineering Platform Project Agent |
| `pcvantol/technical-debt-engine` | Technical Debt Engine product authority |
| `pcvantol/forge-platform` | Universal distribution, deployment, and release composition |
| `pcvantol/ai-development-contracts` | Generic AI-development contract authority |
| `pcvantol/ai-platform-engineering-knowledge-base` | Generalized and certified engineering knowledge authority |

Forge, Workspace, and Engineering Platform are peers. No product repository is a parent source authority for another.

The Knowledge Base is currently a Git-backed, repository-local CLI capability, not a Workspace/EP server role and not a current Forge Platform installer component. It owns source onboarding, observation, knowledge lifecycle, certification, and publications. Forge Platform may later distribute a qualified KB artifact, but owns neither its runtime nor its knowledge authority.

## Product boundaries

### Forge Runtime

Forge owns product/system architecture planning, roadmap and backlog reasoning where Forge-owned, engineering intent, development-lane planning, cross-repository dependency planning, and the conceptual determination of work that may run in parallel. It does not own local repository execution, EP scheduling implementation, EP evidence/qualification, Workspace shared UI state, Project Agent behavior, or universal installation.

### Workspace Server and Workspace Client

Workspace Server is the shared control-plane and product-team state service. It owns Workspace project state, topology presentation, shared team/user status, Workspace-owned lane and scheduling UX state, sessions, and aggregation of Forge and EP information. It is not execution authority.

Workspace Client is human-facing UX. It authenticates to a Workspace Server and presents the same server-authoritative shared project state as other clients, subject to permissions. It can initiate canonical control-plane actions, but does not become shared-state authority or directly execute engineering work through an Agent.

Local facts such as repository presence, current branch, IDE availability, and installed tools may augment shared state. They never redefine authoritative product/project truth. A Workspace Client without a Project Agent is a valid first-class deployment: it supports shared views, planning/status, reports, and permitted remote actions through eligible Agents, but not local repository, host, or IDE operations.

### Engineering Platform Server and Project Agent

Engineering Platform Server is execution authority. It owns engineering admission, durable queueing/scheduling, lane admission, host/agent selection, repository lock/lease lifecycle, provider execution, validation, qualification, evidence, EP-owned Prompt History, finalization/execution state, Consumer API, and server-side Agent protocol authority. Forge and Workspace do not bypass it. It alone decides whether advertised Agent capacity becomes an admitted execution; an Agent never self-admits work merely because it has a free slot.

Engineering Platform Project Agent belongs solely to `pcvantol/engineering-platform`. One installed Agent service/process per Host/OS-user context may serve zero or more locally attached repositories. It owns the local repository/Git/filesystem boundary, attachment/discovery, host-capability discovery, bounded local execution, secure local credential handling, health, approved local IPC, and protocol communication with EP Server. For post-verification parallel execution it advertises a bounded capacity (for example `max_parallel_executions` or execution slots), but that is availability input to EP admission rather than scheduling authority. It is not owned by Forge, Workspace, or Forge Platform.

An Agent is not one binary or process per repository. A repository may later contain non-secret declarative configuration such as `.engineering/project.json`; secrets remain in OS-native secure credential storage.

## Project, repository, host, Agent, and lane model

| Domain identity | Canonical relationship |
| --- | --- |
| Project | Has exactly one Canonical Project Authority Repository and zero or more Child Repositories. |
| Repository | Belongs to one logical Project context when attached and may be available on one or more Hosts. |
| Host | A machine or environment. |
| Engineering Platform Project Agent | Local repository and execution capability on one Host; exposes zero or more repositories. |
| Execution Lane | Belongs to one Project, targets one or more repositories, has dependencies, and requires repository execution resources/locks. |

A single-repository Project is the trivial case: its Canonical Project Authority Repository is also its only source/execution repository. No separate architecture is required.

A multi-repository Project has one Canonical Project Authority Repository plus zero or more autonomous Child Repositories. Child membership is a project-topology relationship, not Git submodule or source-control subordination.

  H1[Alice Mac] --> I
  H2[Bob Windows] --> A
  H3[Carol Mac] --> W
  H4[Shared Mac mini] --> CPA
```

The Canonical Project Authority Repository owns durable, versioned cross-repository concerns: product-wide architecture and ADRs, Forge and Workspace project definitions, membership/topology, EP project topology/configuration, appropriate product-wide AI-development projection/extension, TDE integration/profile, and cross-repository planning boundaries. It need not contain application source.

Logical topology is **Project → repositories, roles, dependencies**. Physical topology is **Repository → available Hosts and Agents**. Versioned project authority documentation/configuration must reconstruct logical topology; Workspace Server persistence is not its sole source of truth. EP uses both topologies for execution eligibility.

## Team, offline, and capability model

Team deployment is first-class: different developers can hold different repositories on different hosts, each with its own Agent. Workspace shared state spans those hosts. EP can observe Agent health, repository availability, host capabilities, and lane status without assuming every host has every checkout.

Agents may be offline. Forge planning and Workspace shared state remain available; EP may wait for an eligible host/Agent rather than infer availability. This document uses no final state-machine constant.

Agents discover host capabilities such as Xcode/iOS signing, .NET/Windows, Android SDK, Docker, Python, Node, OS, and architecture. Forge may express planning requirements; EP alone determines actual eligibility and admission.

## Execution lanes, dependencies, locks, and post-verification parallelism

Forge plans lane dependencies. EP admits executable work and enforces ordering.

The safe initial concurrency rule is **at most one mutating Execution Lane per Repository at a time**. Repository-level locks are the initial resource model:

- a lane touching `ios` locks `ios`;
- a lane touching the Canonical Project Authority Repository and `ios` locks both;
- an Android-only lane may proceed concurrently if it has no plan dependency.

Resource exclusion and plan dependency are distinct. The same repository excludes simultaneous mutation even without a planned dependency. Different repositories may still need A → B sequencing because Forge planned it. The repository lock/lease is the resource-exclusion boundary: EP durably grants, renews, releases, and recovers it; neither Forge, Workspace, nor an Agent may replace it with a local convention.

### Post-`STANDALONE_EP_VERIFIED` multi-repository parallel lane execution

The first qualified parallelism capability is **parallel mutating execution across different repositories**. It starts only after `STANDALONE_EP_VERIFIED` and is deliberately narrower than general distributed execution or same-repository concurrency.

```text
Forge DAG/dependencies ──plans──> EP Server admission/durable state
                                      ├─ repository A lock/lease → Agent slot 1 → lane A
                                      ├─ repository B lock/lease → Agent slot 2 → lane B
                                      └─ repository A busy or A → B dependency → queued
```

- Forge plans the DAG, dependencies, and intent, but is not execution authority and cannot admit a lane.
- EP matches an eligible Host and Agent capability, evaluates dependency state, repository lock/lease availability and bounded Agent capacity, then applies backpressure and fairness before admission. It owns lane-scoped evidence, validation and finalization even when several lanes run at once.
- A Project Agent may expose `0..N` repositories for its Host/OS-user context and advertises bounded executable capacity; it safely manages only the executions EP has admitted.
- Workspace presents and controls the resulting state only through its permitted control-plane and UX boundary. It does not allocate slots, grant locks, schedule work, or directly execute it.
- At most one mutating lane may hold a given repository's lease. Independent repositories may mutate in parallel only when their Forge-planned dependencies are satisfied. A multi-repository lane must hold every required repository lease before it mutates any target.

This gives direct safe acceleration for independent work in Forge, Workspace, Engineering Platform, Forge Platform, and other autonomous repositories. It does not imply that all such work is independent: Forge can still require a sequence between otherwise separately lockable repositories.

Same-repository parallel execution through multiple worktrees, declared disjoint scopes, and explicit handling of shared generated or migration resources is a later, separately qualified capability. It is not required for the first multi-repository parallelism milestone.

## Deployment, artifacts, and installer roles

Forge Platform owns universal installation, deployment profiles, component selection, manifests, validated compatibility matrix, artifact acquisition/verification, topology bootstrap, upgrades, repair, uninstall, installer/updater UX, and installation receipts.

It consumes independently published artifacts and does not compile or repackage product source as a hidden monolith:

| Product repository | Artifact ownership |
| --- | --- |
| Forge | Forge Runtime artifact |
| Workspace | Workspace Server and Workspace Client artifacts |
| Engineering Platform | Engineering Platform Server and Engineering Platform Project Agent artifacts |
| Forge Platform | Validated composition and distribution of those artifacts |

A Forge Platform release is a tested composition, not a monorepo source version. Each product owns its version and protocol implementation; Forge Platform owns the cross-product compatibility declaration used for a platform release/install.

### CENTRAL transition and future relocation boundary

The historical DJConnect-hosted EP to standalone CENTRAL transition is clean-slate: it creates a fresh official Schema 41 CENTRAL database and new standalone identities. No legacy database is migrated into CENTRAL. The explicitly retained legacy store is immutable forensic history, not runtime input or a fallback authority.

After `STANDALONE_EP_VERIFIED`, Engineering Platform may define and qualify a supported standalone CENTRAL relocation capability for moving an existing operational CENTRAL to another host, first concretely MacBook to Mac mini. Engineering Platform alone owns export/import, admission quiescence, integrity and compatibility checks, snapshot/restore, new-host binding, recovery, health qualification, and Agent endpoint/trust transition semantics. Operational CENTRAL history may be portable only under that EP-owned contract.

Host-local state is not portable by default: launchd definitions/state, PIDs, locks, sockets, caches, absolute host paths, host diagnostics, and other machine-specific runtime material must be regenerated or explicitly handled by Engineering Platform. Before implementation, EP must decide and publish whether logical CENTRAL identity is portable and how it relates to newly established physical Server installation and host identities. Agent endpoint rebind, re-pairing, stale-trust invalidation, and credential rotation are likewise EP-owned contract behavior.

Forge Platform may compose the user journey around qualified EP artifacts—for example, choosing a new CENTRAL or invoking an EP-provided restore/relocate flow—and retain deployment receipts. It is not an owner of CENTRAL migration, data, trust, Agent credential, or recovery semantics.

Installable roles remain independent:

| Role class | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Server | Forge Runtime; Workspace Server; Engineering Platform Server |
| Local | Engineering Platform Project Agent; Workspace Client |

Conceptual presets are Complete Forge Platform, Server, Developer Workstation, and Custom. A Project Agent may be installed without a Workspace Client (for example, a dedicated Linux, Windows, or Xcode host), and a Workspace Client may be installed without an Agent. A typical developer workstation has both, with independent trust relationships.

```

## Trust and runtime boundaries

There are three distinct relationships:

1. **Workspace Client ↔ Workspace Server:** user/client/session trust. LAN presence is not authorization.
2. **Project Agent ↔ EP Server:** host/agent execution trust. Agent identity and credentials are independent of Workspace user authentication.
3. **Workspace Client ↔ local Project Agent:** machine-local repository/host UX integration. It may expose health/version, local project attachment, repository metadata/status, host/tool capability, IDE opening, and other approved local UX operations. It cannot bypass EP admission, provider execution, durable scheduling, finalization/merge authority, direct task execution, or TDE.

The future **EP Local Project Agent API Contract** is owned by Engineering Platform; Workspace owns its consumer/adapter implementation. Forge Platform owns neither side of that protocol.

Knowledge-specific boundaries are separate from these three relationships. A Knowledge Source is read-only to KB operations; KB lifecycle writes occur in the KB repository or an explicit output location. Certified Knowledge is consumed read-only and traceably. Execution outcomes, Agent facts, Forge planning outputs, and TDE evidence are not Certified Knowledge unless independently promoted through the KB lifecycle and governed certification.

Co-location changes no authority. An EP Server and Project Agent on the same machine still use the canonical Agent↔Server contract; EP Server does not directly access local repositories. Localhost never implies trust or authentication bypass.

The family runtime rule is: **source checkouts develop, test, and build; published/installed artifacts run.** In particular, an Engineering Platform source checkout never becomes runtime authority.

### Two-project B8C qualification and extraction boundary

Immediately after B8, CENTRAL and the same Project Agent qualify their real multi-project behavior using two attached development projects: DJConnect and the Engineering Platform source checkout. The latter is an ordinary development repository/project declared by `.engineering-platform/repository.json`; it is not a disposable fixture and it is not a self-hosted execution target. The installed EP Server/Agent artifacts remain the only runtime authority. B8C must prove project-selector behavior, strict `project_id` isolation for queue/runs/reports/Prompt History/evidence/status, correct distinction between installation-wide diagnostics and project data, browser refresh/deep-link/selection safety, and fail-closed absence of cross-project leakage.

B9 subsequently exercises the first governed execution only for DJConnect: CENTRAL → Project Agent → DJConnect isolated worktree → provider/Codex → validation, qualification, evidence, and finalization. A successful B9 establishes `STANDALONE_EP_VERIFIED`. Only then may DJConnect retire its active generic EP implementation/runtime/source duplicates under a zero-live-duplicate audit. That audit protects historical prompts, receipts, provenance, the `HISTORY_ONLY` legacy database, migration/extraction evidence, `.engineering-platform/repository.json`, and necessary DJConnect-specific installed-EP consumer adapters. It does not permit historical evidence to be erased or the EP source checkout to become runtime authority.

After `STANDALONE_EP_VERIFIED`, EP self-hosting, CENTRAL relocation, and multi-repository parallelism are separate qualification lanes. They may be planned in parallel with the DJConnect cleanup, but none replaces or changes its independently auditable `EP_EXTRACTION_CUTOVER_COMPLETE` end gate.

## Explicitly open implementation questions

The following are intentionally not canonicalized here:

- Workspace↔local-Agent transport and IPC mechanism;
- Project topology manifest schema;
- network discovery protocol;
- concrete authentication and pairing mechanisms;
- detailed Agent protocol and Local Agent API;
- Workspace Server persistence implementation;
- durable scheduling API;
- same-repository parallel execution contract.

## Terminology

Use these terms consistently: **Forge Runtime**, **Workspace Server**, **Workspace Client**, **Engineering Platform Server**, **Engineering Platform Project Agent**, **Forge Platform**, **Project**, **Canonical Project Authority Repository**, **Child Repository**, **Host**, and **Execution Lane**. “Adapter” is only a consumer/UX term where needed; the runtime component is the Engineering Platform Project Agent.
